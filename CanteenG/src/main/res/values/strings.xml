      "Not everyone live their dream. Even more, not everyone build dreams. The founders of CanteeenG chose to build not just theirs, Brought up abroad, they have seen possibilities, potentials and understood what needed to be done in bringing their beloved hometown to the eyes of the world. Their inspiration is the people.\n\n"

        "Why then, CanteenG? Simple, delicious and enjoyable to be shared over small talks or family gathering. Just like College, bringing back the good old memories of ‘comfort food’. Dining at College has another perk; it’s nutritious. And so the idea of freshness and quality surfaced. Only good ingredients are to be used, only the quality ones. This is after all, for my College people.\n\n"

        "Part of the secret to Borenos’ signature tender juiciness comes from step-to-step perfection, with just the right amount of marination, breading skills and controlling the oil temperature to lock in flavors to achieve that golden coat of crispy skin, and tender meat.\n\n"
